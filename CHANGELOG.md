# v2.5.0

# v2.4.0

## Highlights

Welcome to the release `v2.4.0` of Immich. This release focuses on bug fixes, QoL improvements, and polished UI components across mobile and the web. Let's dive right in.

* Show the owner's name in the shared album
* Command palette
* Change search type directly in the search bar
* Better action button placement in the mobile asset viewer
* Notable fix: fix an issue where metadata extraction could fail on high concurrency

### Show the owner's name in the shared album.

On the web, in shared albums, you can now toggle an option to display the asset's owner name at the bottom right corner of the thumbnail.

### Command palette

The web app now has an integrated command palette, which can be opened  with `ctrl + k` on Windows/Linux or `cmd + k` on macOS. The first iteration of this lets you quickly navigate between administration pages by typing the name of the page you want to go to. It also already supports some common actions when on the respective admin pages, many of which also support shortcuts. Have a look around and check them out!

### Change search type directly in the search bar

You can now click on the pill from the search bar to select a different search type without opening the search filter panel.

### Better placement of action buttons in the mobile asset viewer

Previously, to perform a specific action on the asset, you needed first to swipe up to open the detail panel, then swipe all the way to the right and tap the action. It limits the discoverability of some actions. To help resolve that issue, all the action buttons in the detail panel are now moved to the drop-down menu when tapping on the vertical dot icon (or kebab menu), along with some buttons that used to be on the top bar, clearing up space to display more useful information when viewing the asset.
